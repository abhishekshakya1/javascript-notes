## Introduction

This repository is part of my personal learning journey and is designed to help anyone who is looking to improve their JavaScript skills. As a beginner or intermediate developer, you can use these notes to get a better understanding of JavaScript’s core concepts, practices, and how to implement them in real-world scenarios.

## Core Concepts

### Variables & Data Types
- **Variables:** Learn about declaring variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- **Data Types:** Understand JavaScript's primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, and `undefined`.

### Functions
- **Function Declaration & Expression:** Explore how to define functions and the difference between function declarations and expressions.
- **Arrow Functions:** A shorthand syntax for writing functions.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions.

### Objects & Arrays
- **Objects:** Understand how to create and manipulate objects.
- **Arrays:** Learn about arrays, array methods, and how to work with arrays.

### Loops & Iterations
- **For Loop:** Basic loop structure and its use.
- **While & Do-While Loops:** Looping with conditions.
- **ForEach, Map, Filter:** Array iteration methods.

### Asynchronous JavaScript
- **Callback Functions:** Using callbacks for asynchronous code.
- **Promises:** How promises help with asynchronous flow.
  
## Advanced Topics

### Closures
- Deep dive into closures and how they help with data privacy and function scoping.

### Promises
- Learn how promises are used to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell.

### Async/Await
- Simplified syntax for working with asynchronous code using `async` and `await`.

### JavaScript Engines & Optimization
- Understand how JavaScript engines work and tips for optimizing performance in web applications.
